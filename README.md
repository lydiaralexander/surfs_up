## Overview of Analysis
W. Avy is eager to open his surf shop, but wants additional information about temperature trends before opening up.

## Surfs Up Analysis - Results

Reviewing the results, one will notice 3 key differences between the two months:
* The minimum temperature for June is 64, while the minimum temperature for December is 56.
* June temperatures have a lower standard deviation meaning the data is more closely gathered to the mean of the data. This indiates the data for June may be a bit more reliable than the higher deviation we see in the December data.
*  The average is about 4 degrees higher for June compared to December.  Even with this difference, both months indicate fine weather for surfing and ice cream.

## Summary of Analysis
Overall, after completing the analysis, W. Avy should feel very comfortable with moving forward to open his surf and ice cream shop.  The analysis shows that both months have temperatures that would draw people to the area for his products and therefore he would be able to remain stable year-round.
